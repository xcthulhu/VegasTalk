  isbn = {978-3-540-43376-7},
  shorttitle = {Isabelle/{{HOL}}},
  abstract = {This volume is a self-contained introduction to interactive proof in high- order logic (HOL), using the proof assistant Isabelle 2002. Compared with existing Isabelle documentation, it provides a direct route into higher-order logic, which most people prefer these days. It bypasses ?rst-order logic and minimizes discussion of meta-theory. It is written for potential users rather than for our colleagues in the research world. Another departure from previous documentation is that we describe Markus Wenzel's proof script notation instead of ML tactic scripts. The l- ter make it easier to introduce new tactics on the ?y, but hardly anybody does that. Wenzel's dedicated syntax is elegant, replacing for example eight simpli?cation tactics with a single method, namely simp, with associated - tions. The book has three parts. \textendash{} The ?rst part, Elementary Techniques, shows how to model functional programs in higher-order logic. Early examples involve lists and the natural numbers. Most proofs are two steps long, consisting of induction on a chosen variable followed by the auto tactic. But even this elementary part covers such advanced topics as nested and mutual recursion. \textendash{} The second part, Logic and Sets, presents a collection of lower-level tactics that you can use to apply rules selectively. It also describes I- belle/HOL's treatment of sets, functions, and relations and explains how to de?ne sets inductively. One of the examples concerns the theory of model checking, and another is drawn from a classic textbook on formal languages.},

  title = {Categories for the {{Working Mathematician}}},
  isbn = {978-0-387-98403-2},
  abstract = {Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.},

The vector price process is given by a semimartingale of a certain class, and the general stochastic integral is used to represent capital gains. Within the framework of this model, we discuss the modern theory of contingent claim valuation, including the celebrated option pricing formula of Black and Scholes. It is shown that the security market is complete if and only if its vector price process has a certain martingale representation property. A multidimensional generalization of the Black-Scholes model is examined in some detail, and some other examples are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {There are numerous characterizations of Shannon entropy and Tsallis entropy as measures of information obeying certain properties. Using work by Faddeev and Furuichi, we derive a very simple characterization. Instead of focusing on the entropy of a probability measure on a finite set, this characterization focuses on the ``information loss'', or change in entropy, associated with a measure-preserving function. Information loss is a special case of conditional entropy: namely, it is the entropy of a random variable conditioned on some function of that variable. We show that Shannon entropy gives the only concept of information loss that is functorial, convex-linear and continuous. This characterization naturally generalizes to Tsallis entropy as well.},
